# [[Ping]]

Ping should remind you of the game ping-pong (table tennis). You throw the ball and expect to get it back. The primary purpose of ping is to check whether you can reach the remote system and that the remote system can reach you back. In other words, initially, this was used to check network connectivity; however, we are more interested in its different uses: checking whether the remote system is online.

In simple terms, the ping command sends a packet to a remote system, and the remote system replies. This way, you can conclude that the remote system is online and that the network is working between the two systems.

If you prefer a pickier definition, the ping is a command that sends an ICMP Echo packet to a remote system. If the remote system is online, and the ping packet was correctly routed and not blocked by any firewall, the remote system should send back an ICMP Echo Reply. Similarly, the ping reply should reach the first system if appropriately routed and not blocked by any firewall.

The objective of such a command is to ensure that the target system is online before we spend time carrying out more detailed scans to discover the running operating system and services.

On your AttackBox terminal, you can start to use ping as `ping MACHINE_IP` or `ping HOSTNAME`. In the latter, the system needs to resolve HOSTNAME to an IP address before sending the ping packet. If you don’t specify the count on a Linux system, you will need to hit `CTRL+c` to force it to stop. Hence, you might consider `ping -c 10 MACHINE_IP` if you just want to send ten packets. This is equivalent to `ping -n 10 MACHINE_IP` on a MS Windows system.

Technically speaking, ping falls under the protocol ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). ICMP supports many types of queries, but, in particular, we are interested in ping (ICMP echo/type 8) and ping reply (ICMP echo reply/type 0). Getting into ICMP details is not required to use ping.

In the following example, we have specified the total count of packets to 5. From the AttackBox’s terminal, we started pinging `MACHINE_IP`. We learned that `MACHINE_IP` is up and is not blocking ICMP echo requests. Moreover, any firewalls and routers on the packet route are not blocking ICMP echo requests either.

AttackBox Terminal

           `user@AttackBox$ ping -c 5 MACHINE_IP
PING MACHINE_IP (MACHINE_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.636 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.483 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.396 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.416 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.445 ms

--- MACHINE_IP ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4097ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.396/0.475/0.636/0.086 ms`
        

In the example above, we saw clearly that the target system is responding. The ping output is an indicator that it is online and reachable. We have transmitted five packets, and we received five replies. We notice that, on average, it took 0.475 ms (millisecond) for the reply to reach our system, with the maximum being 0.636 ms.  

From a penetration testing point of view, we will try to discover more about this target. We will try to learn as much as possible, for example, which ports are open and which services are running.

Let’s consider the following case: we shut down the target virtual machine and then tried to ping `MACHINE_IP`. As you would expect in the following example, we don’t receive any reply.

AttackBox Terminal

           `user@AttackBox$ ping -c 5 MACHINE_IP
PING MACHINE_IP (MACHINE_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=4 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=5 Destination Host Unreachable

--- MACHINE_IP ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 0 received, +5 errors, 100% packet loss, time 4098ms
pipe 4`
        

In this case, we already know that we have shut down the target computer that has MACHINE_IP. For each ping, the system we are using, AttackBox in this case, is responding with “Destination Host Unreachable.” We can see that we have transmitted five packets, but none was received, resulting in a 100% packet loss.  

Generally speaking, when we don’t get a ping reply back, there are a few explanations that would explain why we didn’t get a ping reply, for example:

-   The destination computer is not responsive; possibly still booting up or turned off, or the OS has crashed.
-   It is unplugged from the network, or there is a faulty network device across the path.
-   A firewall is configured to block such packets. The firewall might be a piece of software running on the system itself or a separate network appliance. Note that MS Windows firewall blocks ping by default.
-   Your system is unplugged from the network.



# [[Traceroute]]

As the name suggests, the traceroute command _traces the route_ taken by the packets from your system to another host. The purpose of a traceroute is to find the IP addresses of the routers or hops that a packet traverses as it goes from your system to a target host. This command also reveals the number of routers between the two systems. It is helpful as it indicates the number of hops (routers) between your system and the target host. However, note that the route taken by the packets might change as many routers use dynamic routing protocols that adapt to network changes.

On Linux and macOS, the command to use is `traceroute 10.10.254.114`, and on MS Windows, it is `tracert 10.10.254.114`. `traceroute` tries to discover the routers across the path from your system to the target system.

There is no direct way to discover the path from your system to a target system. We rely on ICMP to “trick” the routers into revealing their IP addresses. We can accomplish this by using a small Time To Live (TTL) in the IP header field. Although the T in TTL stands for time, TTL indicates the maximum number of routers/hops that a packet can pass through before being dropped; TTL is not a maximum number of time units. When a router receives a packet, it decrements the TTL by one before passing it to the next router. The following figure shows that each time the IP packet passes through a router, its TTL value is decremented by 1. Initially, it leaves the system with a TTL value of 64; it reaches the target system with a TTL value of 60 after passing through 4 routers.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/e82c42dcfae78ac592a8d7843465d2d6.png)

However, if the TTL reaches 0, it will be dropped, and an ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded would be sent to the original sender. In the following figure, the system set TTL to 1 before sending it to the router. The first router on the path decrements the TTL by 1, resulting in a TTL of 0. Consequently, this router will discard the packet and send an ICMP time exceeded in-transit error message. Note that some routers are configured not to send such ICMP messages when discarding a packet.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/948388c823b156813fa30225c2fa3f05.png)

On Linux, `traceroute` will start by sending UDP datagrams within IP packets of TTL being 1. Thus, it causes the first router to encounter a TTL=0 and send an ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded back. Hence, a TTL of 1 will reveal the IP address of the first router to you. Then it will send another packet with TTL=2; this packet will be dropped at the second router. And so on. Let’s try this on live systems.

In the following examples, we run the same command, `traceroute tryhackme.com` from TryHackMe’s AttackBox. We notice that different runs might lead to different routes taken by the packets.

In the traceroute output above, we have 14 numbered lines; each line represents one router/hop. Our system sends three packets with TTL set to 1, then three packets with TTL set to 2, and so forth. Depending on the network topology, we might get replies from up to 3 different routers, depending on the route taken by the packet. Consider line number 12, the twelfth router with the listed IP address has dropped the packet three times and sent an ICMP time exceeded in-transit message. The line `12 99.83.69.207 (99.83.69.207) 17.603 ms 15.827 ms 17.351 ms` shows the time in milliseconds for each reply to reach our system.

On the other hand, we can see that we received only a single reply on the third line. The two stars in the output `3 * 100.66.16.176 (100.66.16.176) 8.006 ms *` indicate that our system didn’t receive two expected ICMP time exceeded in-transit messages.

Finally, in the first line of the output, we can see that the packets leaving the AttackBox take different routes. We can see two routers that responded to TTL being one. Our system never received the third expected ICMP message.

In the second run of the traceroute program, we noticed that the packets took a longer route this time, passing through 26 routers. If you are running a traceroute to a system within your network, the route will be unlikely to change. However, we cannot expect the route to remain fixed when the packets need to go via other routers outside our network.

To summarize, we can notice the following:

-   The number of hops/routers between your system and the target system depends on the time you are running traceroute. There is no guarantee that your packets will always follow the same route, even if you are on the same network or you repeat the traceroute command within a short time.
-   Some routers return a public IP address. You might examine a few of these routers based on the scope of the intended penetration testing.
-   Some routers don’t return a reply.
